# 🚀 RISC-V SoC RTL → GDSII Journey  

![banner](assets/banner.png)

Welcome to my repository documenting my **week-by-week progress** through the  
**RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** ⚡.  

This repo is my hands-on logbook as I explore how to take a **System-on-Chip (SoC)**  
from **RTL design to GDSII layout** using **open-source EDA tools**.
