# 🚀 RISC-V SoC RTL → GDSII | VSD Program  



Welcome to this repository my **week-by-week progress** through the  
**RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** ⚡.  

In this repository i will upload week by week of my progress in this program of **RISC-V**
from **RTL design to GDSII layout** using **open-source EDA tools**.

## 🎯 Aim to Achieve  

Through this journey, I aim to **design and implement a RISC-V processor** using fully **open-source tools** 🛠️.  
The complete flow covers every stage of a modern VLSI design pipeline:  

- ✍️ **RTL Coding** → Writing clean hardware description in **Verilog**.  
- 🔄 **Synthesis** → Converting RTL into a **netlist** using tools like Yosys.  
- 🧩 **Standard Cell Mapping** → Binding logic into reusable **library cells**.  
- 🏗️ **Physical Design** → Floorplanning, placement, and clock tree synthesis (CTS).  
- 🛣️ **Routing** → Signal & power routing for chip connectivity.  
- ⏱️ **Timing Analysis (STA)** → Ensuring the design meets all timing requirements.  

👉 The ultimate goal: **a silicon-ready GDSII** representation of a working RISC-V SoC 🚀.

## 💡 Key Learnings  
Throughout this program, I explored not just tools, but also the **fundamentals of modern digital VLSI design**.  
Some of the technical highlights include:  

- 🧮 **Digital Design Concepts** → RTL modeling of arithmetic & control units for RISC-V ISA.  
- 🔄 **Logic Synthesis** → Mapping RTL into optimized **gate-level netlists** using Yosys.  
- 🧩 **Standard Cell Libraries** → Understanding cell characterization, PDK usage, and cell mapping.  
- ⏱️ **Static Timing Analysis (STA)** → Setup/Hold time checks, timing closure, and slack optimization.  
- 🏗️ **Physical Design** → Floorplanning, placement, and clock tree synthesis (CTS) strategies.  
- 🛣️ **Routing & DRC/LVS** → Signal and power routing with design rule compliance.  
- 🖥️ **Open-Source EDA Flow** → End-to-end SoC design with tools like **Icarus Verilog, GTKWave, Yosys, and OpenROAD**.  

👉 This journey built a strong foundation in **RTL-to-GDSII design methodology**, while deepening my understanding of **RISC-V processor implementation**.
