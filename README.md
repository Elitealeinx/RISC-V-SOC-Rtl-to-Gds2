# 🚀 RISC-V SoC RTL → GDSII | VSD Program  



Welcome to this repository my **week-by-week progress** through the  
**RISC-V SoC Tapeout Program (VSD)** ⚡.  

In this repository i will upload week by week of my progress in this program of **RISC-V**
from **RTL design to GDSII layout** using **open-source EDA tools**.
